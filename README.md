# Random-Password-Generator
This is a simple Python script that generates a random password using digits, letters, and punctuation. The generated password is 8 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.


How It Works:-
The script uses Python's built-in random and string modules to randomly select characters from a predefined set of digits, letters, and punctuation. The password is generated by selecting 8 random characters from this set.
